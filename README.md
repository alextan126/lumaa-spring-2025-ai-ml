This is a simple movie recommendation system built by Ruiling Tan. After clone the repo, I highly recommend you to create a virtual environment to install all the necessary packages. After installing all the packages, go to recommendation_system jupyter notebook. Set the kernels to myenv and run the note book.
Here is a video demo, check it out:


Create a Virtual Environment:  
   python3 -m venv myenv  

Activate the Virtual Environment:  
   On Windows:  
   myenv\Scripts\activate  
   On macOS/Linux:  
   source myenv/bin/activate  

Install Dependencies in the Virtual Environment:  
   pip install -r requirements.txt
